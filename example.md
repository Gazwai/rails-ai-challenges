Great! Here's how to break down your task:\n\n1. **Define the method `tag`**:\n   - Accept at least two parameters: the tag name and an optional attributes array.\n   - Use a default value for the attributes parameter (e.g., `attributes = nil`).\n\n2. **Handle the optional attributes parameter**:\n   - Check if attributes are provided.\n   - If so, format the attribute as a string like ` key=\"value\"`.\n\n3. **Create the opening and closing tags**:\n   - Use string interpolation to insert the tag name.\n   - Include the formatted attributes inside the opening tag if they exist.\n\n4. **Implement the block execution**:\n   - Capture the content generated inside the block using `yield`.\n   - Place this content between the opening and closing tags.\n\n5. **Support nested tags**:\n   - Since `tag` calls can be nested within one another, ensure your method is flexible and calls `yield` properly inside the block.\n\n6. **Test your method with the provided examples**.\n\nNext step:\n- Write a simple version of the method with just a tag name and block.\n- Add the optional attributes parameter.\n- Handle the case when attributes are provided.\n- Test with simple nested calls.\n\nWould you like guidance on how to start coding each part?
